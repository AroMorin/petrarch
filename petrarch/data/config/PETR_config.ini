# INTERFACE OPTIONS: uncomment to activate
# Default: set all of these false, which is equivalent to an A)utocode in TABARI

# code_by_sentence: show events after each sentence has been coded; default is to 
#                   show events after all of the sentences in a story have been coded
code_by_sentence = True
# pause_by_sentence: pause after the coding of each sentence. Entering 'Return' will 
#                    cause the next sentence to be coded; entering any character will 
#                    cause the program to exit. Default is to code without any pausing.

# CODING OPTIONS: 
# Defaults are more or less equivalent to TABARI

# new_actor_length: Maximum length for new actors extracted from noun phrases if no 
#                   actor or agent generating a code is found. To disable and just 
#                   use null codes "---", set to zero; this is the default. 
#                   Setting this to a large number will extract anything found in a (NP
#                   noun phrase, though usually true actors contain a small number of words 
#                   This must be an integer.

# require_dyad: Events require a non-null source and target: setting this false is likely
#               to result in a very large number of nonsense events. As happened with the 
#               infamous GDELT data set of 2013-2014. And certainly no one wants to see 
#               that again.

# stop_on_error: If True, parsing errors causing the program to halt; typically used for 
#                debugging. With the default [false], the error is written to the error 
#                file, record is skipped, and processing continues.

# commas: These adjust the length (in words) of comma-delimited clauses that are eliminated 
#         from the parse. To deactivate, set the max to zero. 
#         Defaults, based on TABARI, are in ()
