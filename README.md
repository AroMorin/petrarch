PETRARCH-Development
====================

Code for the stand-alone development version of PETARCH (PETR.coder.py and associated modules)

See the header of PETR_coder.py for details on the current state of the program. In a 
nutshell, this works -- it coded 60,000 AFP sentences from the GigaWord corpus without 
crashing, using the included dictionaries -- but the pattern matching is only partially 
implemented (and there are about six known potentially lethal errors that are currently 
trapped in order to avoid crashes), so effectively it is an exceedingly conservative coder.

Documentation could also use a little work (really??) but is fairly complete, though 
scattered in """...""" blocks throughout the program.

Due to constraints on time, this has not been retrofitted into the structure found in 
the "PETRARCH" repo: we will eventually do this.
